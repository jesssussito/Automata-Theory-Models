# Automata Theory & Computational Models 🧠

### 📄 Overview
This repository contains formal models and simulations of theoretical computing machines, exploring the limits of computation, algorithmic complexity, and syntax analysis.

### 🧩 Models Implemented
* **Finite Automata (DFA / NFA):** Design of deterministic and non-deterministic states for pattern recognition.
* **Turing Machines:** Simulation of algorithmic logic and computability problems, ( We developed in pairs at the university ( in the pc of my teanmate ) so only appears his name.
* **Context-Free Grammars:** Structures for formal language syntax analysis and parsing.

### 💻 Tools & Technologies
* **JFLAP:** Software used for designing and simulating the visual automata models.
* **Formal Logic:** Mathematical proofs and state transition diagrams.

### 🎓 Context
Developed for the *Automata Theory and Formal Languages* course at the **University of Salamanca (USAL)**.
